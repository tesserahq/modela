    opentelemetry-instrumentation-fastapi==0.63b1's _get_route_details() guards
    AttributeError only on the Match.FULL branch, not Match.PARTIAL. FastAPI
    >=0.137 wraps include_router()'d routers in _IncludedRouter, which lacks
    a .path attribute and matches as PARTIAL for most requests, crashing every
    request with AttributeError. Fixed upstream in 0.64b0, but that version
    requires opentelemetry-sdk>=1.43 which conflicts with logfire (pulled in
    via pydantic-ai) capping it at <1.43. Patch locally until that's resolved.
